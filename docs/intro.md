# Introduction to Physical AI

Physical AI represents the next frontier of artificial intelligence, moving beyond static data processing to active real-world interaction. Unlike traditional AI, which exists in digital silos, Physical AI is embodied. It requires a deep understanding of physics, real-time perception, and complex actuation. 

The convergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and robotics has accelerated this field. We are moving from robots that follow rigid pre-programmed paths to robots that can understand natural language instructions and adapt to unstructured environments. In this chapter, we explore the foundational pillars of embodied intelligence: perception-action loops, spatial reasoning, and the challenges of the "sim-to-real" gap.

### Key Concepts in Physical AI
1. **Embodiment:** The idea that intelligence requires a physical body to interact with the world.
2. **Proprioception:** A robot's internal sense of its own joint positions and movements.
3. **Latency:** The critical need for low-latency processing to ensure safety in physical environments.
