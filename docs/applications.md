Robotics and Physical AI are moving out of research labs and into every sector of the economy.

### Industrial Automation
Next-generation "Cobots" (Collaborative Robots) work alongside humans in factories, handling repetitive tasks while humans handle complex decision-making.

### Logistics and Warehousing
Mobile robots (AMRs) like those in Amazon fulfillment centers have revolutionized how goods move, using autonomous navigation to sort and carry thousands of pounds of inventory.

### Domestic and Service Robotics
The ultimate goal of humanoid robotics is the domestic assistant—a robot capable of doing laundry, preparing meals, and providing elder care. This requires "General Purpose" intelligence that can handle the infinite variety of a human home.
